	h1 MixCloud RSS thingy
	p.lead Want an RSS feed for a MixCloud account? I did too, so I made this. 
	p
		input#mixcloud-profile.input-xxlarge(type="text", placeholder="MixCloud URL", data-title="MixCloud profile URL or profile name", data-delay={ show: 500, hide: 0 })
		a#submit.btn.btn-primary.btn-large(href="#") Gimme

#response
	#busy.progress.progress-striped.active
		#progress-bar.bar

	#alert-success.alert.alert-success Yay! The RSS URL you want is in the box below. Just to prove it works, here&rsquo;s the latest Cloudcast from 
	#results
		.input-append
			input#mixcloud-url.input-xxlarge(type="text")
			span.add-on Your magic URL
		#test.well

	#alert-not-found.alert Sorry, that account doesn&rsquo;t seem to exist. Could you check you&rsquo;ve got it right?

	#alert-error.alert.alert-error 
		p Hm. Something&rsquo;s gone wrong. It could be there&rsquo;s a problem with my site or that MixCloud&rsquo;s down, or (most probably) you&rsquo;ve found a bug. 
		p I suggest entering the MixCloud profile info again to see if that fixes it. If it doesn&rsquo;t, please 
			a(href="http://meloncholy/contact/") send me a message
			| , making sure to include the exact text you put in the textbox so I can look into it for you. Sorry about that.

	#alert-bad-user.alert I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t understand the profile you entered. Please paste MixCloud profile&rsquo;s URL or type the username into the box above and try again.
